---Instructions
Open CMD/Power shell at ...project path\src
1.Type: javac scrape.java
2.Type: java  scrape "Movie Name" Results Number   example-->  java scrape "star trek" 5
3.Open the text file MovieResults.txt at the same folder for the results.


Remarks:
I used jsoup library as a tool for parsing and finding information at imdb.
The library has a slow run time so its best to choose minimal number for the results.
I searched for movie names that containing the search string as a whole only.
